    "Welcome to the Catalog Archive Server Jobs System, or CasJobs. This guide assumes you have experience with basic SQL syntax. If you'd like to learn more about SQL, you can follow the SkyServer link above which has a SQL Tutorial in its Help section, but there are also plenty of other tutorials on the web. This guide will cover the slightly simpler varient of SQL that CasJobs uses.\n",

    "### Registration\n",
    "Before you can query this system you'll need to register and then log in. Your queries and their resulting data are associated with your account, so don't forget your login! But if lightning strikes, skies fall and you've consequently forgot your password it can be emailed to you from here. Your email may be used to contact you about your account, as well as optionally notifing about query completion. Your UserID will be used to identify you to the group world; should you choose to participate in this please pick a 'nice' UserID. A personal database, or MyDB is also created and assigned to your account on registration.\n",

    "### Running a Query in CasJobs\n",
    "The Query page is the first page you will see once you log into CasJobs. However, before you run a query, you need to select the `Context`, i.e., the database on which your query will be run. Please read the following few sections including 'Context and Queues' before you attempt to run a query for the first time, else you may get unexpected errors (e.g. \"Invalid object name\"). Also remember that only queries on MyDB tables should generally be run in the MyDB context, because the MyDB context has very limited resources for running queries.\n",

    "### MyDB\n",
    "Your MyDB is a personal database created just for you upon registration. You have full privileges in this context; you can create/alter/drop tables, functions and stored procedures. It is designed to be a sort of staging area where you refine your requested data before eventually extracting it to a local copy in CSV, FITS, etc. format. Please note that you can only extract data from MyDB, so any data you will eventually want a local copy of must first be put into MyDB.\n",

    "Getting data into MyDB is easy. Just write your query, then click submit and it will automatically create a table using the name from the 'Table' field (directly above the query box) in MyDB containing the results of your query. Alternatively, you use an 'into' statement in your query; an example of this is below.\n",

    "\n",
    "This will create a table called 'MyFirstTable' in MyDB containing the columns specified by the select clause. `into` statements are generally placed directly before the `from` keyword of a query. If your query doesn't have a `from`, then `into` just goes at the end. An into statement in your query always takes precedence over whatever is in the `Table` field, so if you have both, only the one in the query is used. Please note that the `Table` field is only used when the submit button is clicked; queries submitted using the quick method will display results by default instead of automatically creating a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** up until now, the tutorial used upper case letters to describe SQL operators such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc. The CasJobs interface is not case sensitive and therefore you can also use lower case letter, or a combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Data Into MyDB\n",
    "You can also import your own, custom data into MyDB. This is done from the `Import` page, link located at the top. More info on importing tables is on that page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Data From MyDB\n",
    "Once you've got a table in MyDB, you can then extract and download that table in CSV, VOTABLE or FITS file format. This is done from the MyDB page. To do this, click MyDB (at the top), then click the table on the left, choose your output type then click extract. You can only extract tables in MyDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context and Queues\n",
    "`Context` is the database on which your query will be run. It is determined by the Context drop down list on the query page. So if something like 'DR10' is selected, then your query will be run on dr10, if 'DR7' then DR7, etc. You should always run your query in the context where most of the data resides, not the MyDB context. Only queries on MyDB tables should generally be run in the MyDB context, because the MyDB context has very limited resources for running queries. The 'Queue' selection, also a drop down list, will determine the maximum time a query will be permitted to run. Every context has at least one queue. If your chosen context has more than one queue it is best to choose the queue that is closest to the amount of time you think your query will take. Queues are optimized for queries of their time limit, so chosing an appropriate queue is generally faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referencing Objects Outside of Context\n",
    "For those situations where you'd like to reference data outside of your selected context you can prefix the foreign object. If you've been following this guide, you've already done this. This query uses a `MyDB` prefix:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Select top 1000 objid,ra,dec \n",
    "into mydb.MyFirstTable \n",
    "from photoobj\n",
    "```\n",
    "So assuming the context of this query was 'DR1', this means that 'MyFirstTable' is to be created at 'MyDB', not 'DR1'. Using prefixes, you could rewrite this query so it runs in 'MyDB' context, like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Select top 1000 objid,ra,dec \n",
    "into MyFirstTable \n",
    "from dr1.photoobj\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since the context has changed to 'MyDB', this time the prefix 'dr1' indicates that the photoobj table is not 'mydb', but 'dr1'. Context prefix can be used on tables and stored procedures, but not functions (see function limitations). Valid context prefixes are any that appear in the context drop down list in the query page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Execution\n",
    "If you head over to the query page, you'll notice there are two buttons at the bottom of the query space, one labelled 'submit', the other 'quick'. These are different types of query execution. 'Quick' is a synchronous execution action; it will run your query right away at the currently selected context and then return the results right below the query window. It is the quickest way to run something and is ideal for quick things like creating functions, procedures, top 10's, etc. However there are restrictions on this form of execution; quick queries are limited to one minute of execution and can only return about one meg of data before they will be cancelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submit Execution\n",
    "For queries that exceed 'quick' limitations use the 'Submit' button. 'Submit' is an asynchronous execution action; it does not return the results right away. It will submit your query to the selected context and queue and will run it as soon as a slot in that queue is available. You can check the status of your queries from the History page, link located at the top of the page. (must be logged in)"

    "When describing SDSS sources, there are two types of identifiers that are very common:\n",
    "1. **plate ID, MJD, and fiber ID**: SDSS is a multi-object spectroscopic survey, meaning that it can analyze the light of multiple objects simultaneously using its spectrographs. To do that, light from multiple objects needs to be guided from the focal plane of the telescope, where it is focused, to the spectrographs that sit at the back of the telescope. This is done using optical fibers – thin cables of glass or plastic, that are very efficient at carrying light from one point to another. SDSS can obtain spectra of up to 1000 objects at a time, by using up to 1000 optical fibers. These fibers need to placed in exactly the right place so as to capture the light of each individual object for which we would like to get a spectrum for. In SDSS, this is done using aluminum plates, called plug plates. Each plate contains up to 1000 holes, drilled to be in exactly the right place so as to collect the light of the required astronomical objects. Up to date, SDSS has drilled over 10,000 plates, each covering a unique part of the sky, and each enabling the collection of spectra of hundreds of unique astronomical objects. \n",
    "![](http://voyages.sdss.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Plate-background-2.png)\n",
    "There are unique identifiers for each plate and fiber. Therefore, a spectrum of a source can be uniquely identified using `plateid` (Plate number), `MJD` (Modified Julian Date of plate observation), and `fiberid` (Fiber number).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Within the SDSS spectroscopic database, each spectroscopic object is given with a unique identifier called `specObjID`. We will usually use this identifier to perform JOIN operations between different table. **Note, however,** that the spectroscopic ID can be different in different data releases (i.e., Contexts), so one has to be careful when selecting the 'Context' of the query.
